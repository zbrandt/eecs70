\begin{homeworkProblem}{Error-Correcting Codes}

    \begin{itemize}
  
        \item[A)] Recall from class the error-correcting code for erasure errors, 
        which protects against up to $k$ lost packets by sending a total of 
        $n+k$ packets (where $n$ is the number of packets in the original 
        message). Often the number of packets lost is not some fixed number $k$, 
        but rather a \emph{fraction} of the number of packets sent. Suppose we 
        wish to protect against a fraction $\alpha$ of lost packets (where 
        $0 < \alpha < 1$). At least how many packets do we need to send (as a 
        function of $n$ and $\alpha$)?

        \item[B)] Repeat part (A) for the case of general errors.

    \end{itemize}
