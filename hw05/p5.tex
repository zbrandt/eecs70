\begin{homeworkProblem}{Error-Correcting Codes}

    \begin{itemize}
  
        \item[A)] Recall from class the error-correcting code for erasure errors, 
        which protects against up to $k$ lost packets by sending a total of 
        $n+k$ packets (where $n$ is the number of packets in the original 
        message). Often the number of packets lost is not some fixed number $k$, 
        but rather a \emph{fraction} of the number of packets sent. Suppose we 
        wish to protect against a fraction $\alpha$ of lost packets (where 
        $0 < \alpha < 1$). At least how many packets do we need to send (as a 
        function of $n$ and $\alpha$)?

        \item[B)] Repeat part (A) for the case of general errors.

    \end{itemize}

    \part 

    For a total amount of packets sent $l$, if $\alpha$ are lost, the amount
    recieved is $(1-\alpha) \cdot l$ packets. To reconstruct the polynomial
    to find the missing $m$'s, the reciever needs to get at the very least 
    $n$ packets. So $n \geq (1-\alpha) \cdot l$ packets and $l$, the number
    of packets we need to send as a function of $n$ and $\alpha$, is 
    $\frac{n}{1-\alpha}$, at least this amount.
    
    \part

    For the case of general errors, when we know that $k$ amount of packages
    are corrupted, we must send $n+2k$ to recover the message. If $l$ is again
    the total amount of packages sent, then we need to protect against $\alpha 
    \cdot l$ errors. So, $l \geq n + 2l\cdot \alpha$, or $l \geq 
    \frac{n}{1-2\alpha}$.
