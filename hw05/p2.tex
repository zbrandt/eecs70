\begin{homeworkProblem}{Secret Sharing}
    
    Suppose the Oral Exam questions are created by 2 TAs and 3 Readers. The 
    answers are all encrypted, and we know that:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] Two TAs together should be able to access the answers
        \item[B)] Three Readers together should be able to access the answers
        \item[C)] One TA and one Reader together should also be able to access the answers
        \item[D)] One TA by themself or two Readers by themselves should not be 
        able to access the answers.
    \end{itemize}

    Design a Secret Sharing scheme to make this work.
