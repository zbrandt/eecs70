\begin{homeworkProblem}{Secret Sharing}
    
    Suppose the Oral Exam questions are created by 2 TAs and 3 Readers. The 
    answers are all encrypted, and we know that:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] Two TAs together should be able to access the answers
        \item[B)] Three Readers together should be able to access the answers
        \item[C)] One TA and one Reader together should also be able to access the answers
        \item[D)] One TA by themself or two Readers by themselves should not be 
        able to access the answers.
    \end{itemize}

    Design a Secret Sharing scheme to make this work.

    \solution

    Create a polynomial of degree 6, give each TA four points and give each Reader
    three points. If both TAs collaborate they can reconstruct the polynomial to
    find the secret since they have at least 7 points. If all Readers collaborate 
    they can also reconstruct the polynomial to find the secret with 2 points to
    spare. If one TA and one Reader collaborate they can reconstruct the polynomial
    with no points to spare. Since one TA only has four points and two Readers only
    have 6 points (1 point away from being able to reconstruct the polynomial), this
    Secret Sharing scheme satisfies the condition.
