\begin{homeworkProblem}{Equivalent Polynomials}

    This problem is about polynomials with coefficients in $\text{GF}(p)$ for some 
    prime $p \in \mathbb{N}$. We say that two such polynomials $f$ and $g$ are 
    \emph{equivalent} if $f(x) \equiv g(x) \pmod{p}$ for every $x \in \text{GF}(p)$. 

    \begin{itemize}
        \item[A)] Show that $f(x)=x^{p-1}$ and $g(x)=1$ are \textbf{not} equivalent
        polynomials under $\text{GF}(p).$
        \item[B)] Use Fermat's Little Theorem to find a polynomial with degree 
        strictly less than 5 that is equivalent to $f(x) = x^5$ over $\text{GF}(5)$; 
        then find a polynomial with degree strictly less than 11 that is equivalent 
        to $g(x) = 4x^{70} + 9x^{11} + 3$ over $\text{GF}(11)$.
        \item[C)] In $\mathrm{GF}(p)$, prove that whenever $f(x)$ has degree $\ge 
        p$, it is equivalent to some polynomial $\tilde f(x)$ with degree $< p$.
    \end{itemize}
