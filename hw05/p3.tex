\begin{homeworkProblem}{To The Moon!}

    A secret number $s$ is required to launch a rocket, and Alice distributed 
    the values $(1,p(1)), (2,p(2)), \dots, 
    (n+1,p(n+1))$ of a degree $n$ polynomial $p(x)$ to a group of 
    \$GME holders $\text{Bob}_1, \dots, \text{Bob}_{n+1}$. As usual, she chose 
    $p(x)$ such that $p(0) = s$. $\text{Bob}_1$ through $\text{Bob}_{n+1}$ now 
    gather to jointly discover the secret. However, $\text{Bob}_1$ is secretly 
    a partner at Melvin Capital and already knows $s$, and wants to sabotage 
    $\text{Bob}_2,\dots, \text{Bob}_{n+1}$, making them believe that the secret 
    is in fact some fixed $s' \neq s$. How could he achieve this? In other 
    words, what value should he report (in terms variables known in the 
    problem, such as $s', s$ or $p(1)$) in order to make the others believe 
    that the secret is $s'$?
