\begin{homeworkProblem}{To The Moon!}

    A secret number $s$ is required to launch a rocket, and Alice distributed 
    the values $(1,p(1)), (2,p(2)), \dots, 
    (n+1,p(n+1))$ of a degree $n$ polynomial $p(x)$ to a group of 
    \$GME holders $\text{Bob}_1, \dots, \text{Bob}_{n+1}$. As usual, she chose 
    $p(x)$ such that $p(0) = s$. $\text{Bob}_1$ through $\text{Bob}_{n+1}$ now 
    gather to jointly discover the secret. However, $\text{Bob}_1$ is secretly 
    a partner at Melvin Capital and already knows $s$, and wants to sabotage 
    $\text{Bob}_2,\dots, \text{Bob}_{n+1}$, making them believe that the secret 
    is in fact some fixed $s' \neq s$. How could he achieve this? In other 
    words, what value should he report (in terms variables known in the 
    problem, such as $s', s$ or $p(1)$) in order to make the others believe 
    that the secret is $s'$?

    \solution
    He should report some value for $p(1)$ such that the reconstructed polynomial
    from $(1, p(1)), (2, p(2)), \dots, (n+1, p(n+1))$, evaluated at 0, returns a
    fixed $s'$ that is not the true secret. Reconstructing the polynomial with \
    Lagrange Interpolation, absent the fixed $s'$, the polynomial is
    \[
        p(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n+1} p(i) \Delta_i(x)
    \]
    But if $\text{Bob}_1$ wants the \$GME holders to reconstruct a polynomial
    where $p(0) = s'$ instead of $s$, the first term of the summation must be
    modified to use $p(1)'$ instead of the true $p(1)$ value
    \[
        p(x)' = p(1)'\Delta_1(x) + \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} p(i) \Delta_i(x)
    \]
    To solve for $p(1)'$ given a fixed $s' \not = s$, a new basis polynomial 
    $\Delta_1(x)'$ is required
    \[
        p(1)' = \frac{s' - \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} p(i)\Delta_i(0)}{\Delta_1(0)'}
    \]
