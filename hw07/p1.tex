\begin{itemize}

    \item[A)] How many ways are there to color the faces of a cube using exactly 
    $6$ colors, such that each face has a different color? Note: two colorings 
    are considered the same if one can be obtained from the other by rotating 
    the cube in any way.
    
    \solution
    hello

    \item How many ways are there to color a bracelet with $n$ beads using 
    $n$ colors, such that each bead has a different color? Note: two colorings 
    are considered the same if one of them can be obtained by rotating the 
    other.
    
    \solution
    % Solution for Part 2 goes here.

    \item How many distinct undirected graphs are there with $n$ labeled 
    vertices? Assume that there can be at most one edge between any two 
    vertices, and there are no edges from a vertex to itself. The graphs do 
    not have to be connected.
    
    \solution
    % Solution for Part 3 goes here.

    \item How many distinct cycles are there in a complete graph $K_n$ with 
    $n$ vertices? Assume that cycles cannot have duplicated edges. Two cycles 
    are considered the same if they are rotations or inversions of each other 
    (e.g. $(v_1,v_2,v_3,v_1)$, $(v_2,v_3,v_1,v_2)$ and $(v_1,v_3,v_2,v_1)$ 
    all count as the same cycle).
