Given:
\begin{itemize}
\item $X$ is a countable, non-empty set. For all $i \in X$, $A_i$ is an 
uncountable set.
\item $Y$ is an uncountable set. For all $i \in Y$, $B_i$ is a countable set.
\end{itemize}

For each of the following, decide if the expression is
"Always countable", "Always uncountable", "Sometimes countable,
Sometimes uncountable".

For the "Always" cases, prove your claim. For the "Sometimes" case, provide
two examples -- one where the expression is countable, and one where
the expression is uncountable.

\begin{itemize}

\item $X \cap Y$

\solution
% Solution for Part 1 goes here.

\item $X \cup Y$

\solution
% Solution for Part 2 goes here.

\item $\bigcup_{i \in X} A_i$

\solution
% Solution for Part 3 goes here.

\item $\bigcap_{i \in X} A_i$

\solution
% Solution for Part 4 goes here.

\item $\bigcup_{i \in Y} B_i$

\solution
% Solution for Part 5 goes here.

\item $\bigcap_{i \in Y} B_i$

\solution
% Solution for Part 6 goes here.

\end{itemize}
