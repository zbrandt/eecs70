\begin{homeworkProblem}{Count It!}
\href{https://www.eecs70.org/assets/pdf/notes/n11.pdf}{Note 11}
For each of the following collections, determine and briefly explain whether 
it is finite, countably infinite (like the natural numbers), or uncountably 
infinite (like the reals):

\begin{itemize}

\item The integers which divide $8$.

\solution
% Solution for Part 1 goes here.

\item The integers which $8$ divides.

\solution
% Solution for Part 2 goes here.

\item The functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$.

\solution
% Solution for Part 3 goes here.

\item The set of strings over the English alphabet. (Note that the strings 
may be arbitrarily long, but each string has finite length. Also the strings 
need not be real English words.)

\solution
% Solution for Part 4 goes here.

\item The set of finite-length strings drawn from a countably infinite 
alphabet, $\mathcal{C}$.

\solution
% Solution for Part 5 goes here.

\item The set of infinite-length strings over the English alphabet.

\solution
% Solution for Part 6 goes here.

\end{itemize}
